## Work to death

I heard a lot of time like Focus on one thing, Working to death, yeah ofc if u are multitasking in you' day, you failed and you will acheive nothing. but health is important to, but how can we improve health? no time for gym or something like that?.

## Walkin to death

if u don't have time for the gym, at least run, if u can't, at least do some push-up, if push-up aren't a option, at least walk to death before or after work. thatâ€™s what i believe. because walking is important act to our body, by experience.
