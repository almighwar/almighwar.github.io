My words is my bond to myself

## You're light of allah on earth

Bismi allah, wa aalayhi tawaklto, allah wafikni fi masaaya, we are the light of allah on earth from the action and things we say, ever and forever don't let the evil break you down, by desires and short pleasure, always keep going prayer and request forgiveness from allah.

## Purpose

Allah create us to change evil to good in the world, so we have to train our body and mind, material and spirit, and build strong relationship with self and our family and brothers and child and wifes to defeat the evil.

Alhamdu li allah for health that give us, for everything in life, water and rain and brain and eyes and legs and hands and heart, alahuma laka lhamd for brothers and sisters and father and mother and everyone we know, and for send prophet mohammed (aalayhi salato wasalam) to guide us from deep dart to light.
