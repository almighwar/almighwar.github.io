## Why I don't give a f**k, about people

People's opinion, people themselves, girlfriends, they are all like events, because they become the past.

For example gf's why would u take care of girl, u think she won't become your wife.

### Why

Why would u think and waste ur time and effort on things will be left you at some point in your life, will become the past, why would you worries about these things? on the necessary things that you should leave from your life.

### Quote not believing

I'm not christian and i believe christianity has been falsified, but i quote from --- Luke 12:25-26

"And which of you by worrying can add one hour to his lifeâ€™s span? So if you are not even able to do a very little thing [such as that], why are you worried about the rest?"
