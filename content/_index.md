The declaration on this website

# The Purpose

This may be a blog for posts but closer to that, in form design it's not at all for posts, but it's for posts, what i learn and my knowledge, and some inspired things, **Programming**, Books, Chess, Run, and advice that i learned from my experience or Old people,  or good role model. 



## Suggest
I confuse if should add menu for easy browsing in this page, i'll think on this one.

<--->
## Task
Website look like **docs** pages, not a website for notes, I like the theme so i put it, but i'll fix that specific issue. in the end the purpose behind it matter than form, to share with people my intrested things.
